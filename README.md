# Symbiosis Golang SDK

## Installation ##

symbiosis-go is compatible with modern Go releases in module mode, with Go installed:

```bash
go get github.com/symbiosis-cloud/symbiosis-go
```

will resolve and add the package to the current development module, along with its dependencies.

Alternatively the same can be achieved if you use import in a package:

```go
import "github.com/symbiosis-cloud/symbiosis-go"
```

and run `go get` without parameters.
